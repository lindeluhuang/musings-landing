                You have curiosities and musings about your work, the world, and yourself. You want to keep them around,
                to intrigue and inspire.

                This minimal notes app lets you record your thoughts and then look back to see what you’ve written
                through
                the weeks, months, or years.

                With Musings, watch the progression of your thinking. See how you’ve changed over time. Reflect on what
                has
